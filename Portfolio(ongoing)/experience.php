      <h1>My experience in the University of Ibadan.</h1>
      <p>
        It has been a wonderful experience studying in on of the best schools in
        Nigeria. Considering the fact that i can in through Direct Entry and had
        to resume straight to 200 Level, it was a little difficult for me to catch
        up. But with the help of my lecturers and my colleagues, I was able to
        catch up.

      <p>
        Learning new things everyday both academically and in my everyday life,
        has made being in school way more fun than I expected.<br />
        My social life has also improved greatly, helping me in making new friends
        and making new connections.
      </p>
      <p>
        There have been challenges, financially, academically and having to adapt
        to living with roommates but overall it has been pretty amazing.
